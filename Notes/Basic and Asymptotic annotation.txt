(1) Use Math equestion solve problem like sum of Natural number.
(2) We always understand Base Case, Average Case and Worst Case
(3) 
	Big O = Exact or Upper
	Theta  = Exact
	Big Omega = Exact or Lower (used in gaming application (minimum user) and string n! permutation (minimum n!))
		
(4)
	i = i+c or i = i-c
		=> Theta n/2 or Theta n
	i = i*c or i = i/c
		=> Theta log n base c
	i = pow(i,c)
		=> Theta log log n
		
(5)
	C < log logn < log n < n^1/3 < n^1/2 < n < n^2 < n^3 < n^4 < 2^n < n^n
	
(6)
    time complexity for recursive = hight of tree

(7)
	T(n-1) + T(n-2) + C = c +2c + 4c = O(2^n)
